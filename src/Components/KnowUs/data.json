Thank you for making the last one year so easy for me in Bangalore. From being called out in meetings for gossiping (I don’t think I’ve ever been more embarrassed 😂) to our personal DSMs — over green tea in the snooker room😂, I honestly don’t think I’ve shared this much about my life with anyone. You know everything about my past, present and future better than anyone else and I know how much you care about me. You’ve been my rock during the rough days and I don’t think I can ever thank you enough for that. All your “Tu darrti hai Kya usse!” pep talks have always been super motivating 😂 All I can say is that we have a cosmic connection and no matter where we are or what we’re doing, I’m confident we’ll always have each other’s back. I’m so proud of everything you’ve achieved and I know this is just the beginning! You’re the cutest inside out Ishi. I love you soooo much and I can’t wait to hug you. Meet me soon! xo"

There are just so many kaands/stories we share. Ishitii is not just a nickname for me, it's an emotion. Kabhi mere upar koi show wagarah bana na toh usmein tu pakka se hogi 😜"
