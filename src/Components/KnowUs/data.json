I have always adored you like a kid and also looked upto you for inspiration several times. I miss our sleepovers, whether it is sata you and me or just you and me. Drunk nights, discussing politics and the world and men, with a tub of ice cream and bowl of of chips!  I wish we could do that more often. I love you, and I am so so proud of the person you were and are today. I wish you a lifetime of happiness and all the love and success. Happiest birthday littul girl, love you tons!❤️❤️"
